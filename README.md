**Note:** There's now [an official DevDocs desktop app](https://github.com/egoist/devdocs-app). You should use that one instead!

devdocs-electron is a macOS app built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) for the [DevDocs API Documentation Browser](http://devdocs.io/) website. It doesn't do much more than wrap the DevDocs website, but frankly, that's the point.

## Installation Notes

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/jgarber623/devdocs-electron/releases) (either `.zip` or `.dmg` will do).
1. Unzip the `.zip` file or mount the `.dmg` downloaded file.
1. Drag the DevDocs app to `/Applications`.
1. Open up `/Applications`, right-click on the DevDos app, and click "Open."
1. Accept the prompt and you're good to go!

The prompt is a side effect of devdocs-electron not being a "signed" macOS app. Signing apps requires an expensive Apple Developer account.
